/* 
  The lastIndexOf() method returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present. The array is searched backwards, starting at fromIndex.

  Syntax
    arr.lastIndexOf(searchElement[, fromIndex])

  Parameters
    searchElement: Element to locate in the array.

    Optional: 
    fromIndex: The index at which to start searching backwards.

    Return value:
    The last index of the element in the array; -1 if not found.
  
  Description: 
    lastIndexOf compares searchElement to elements of the Array using strict equality (the same method used by the ===, or triple-equals, operator).
