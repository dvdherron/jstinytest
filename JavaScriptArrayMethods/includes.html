/*
Array.prototype.includes()
  The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.

Syntax:
  arr.includes(valueToFind[, fromIndex])

Parameters: 
  valueToFind: The value to search for.

  Optional:
    from Index:
    The position in this array at which to begin searching for valueToFind; the first character to be searched is found at fromIndex for positive values of fromIndex, or at array.length + fromIndex for negative values of fromIndex (using the absolute value of fromIndex as the number of characters from the end of the string at which to start the search). Defaults to 0.

Return Value:
  A Boolean which is true if the value valueToFind is found within the array (or the part of the array indicated by the index fromIndex, if specified). Values of zero are all considered to be equal regardless of sign (that is, -0 is considered to be equal to both 0 and +0), but false is not considered to be the same as 0.

Requirements:
 [done] Determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.
 [done] The first character to be searched is found at fromIndex for positive values of fromIndex
 [done] FromIndex defaults to 0.
 [done] Values of zero are all considered to be equal regardless of sign (that is, -0 is considered to be equal to both 0 and +0), but false is not considered to be the same as 0.
 [done] If fromIndex is greater than or equal to the length of the array, false is returned. The array will not be searched.
 [done] If fromIndex is negative, the computed index is calculated to be used as a position in the array at which to begin searching for valueToFind. 
 [done] If the computed index is less to or equal than -1 * array.length, the entire array will be searched.
